## üí°Motivation 

- Searching for the name of accesories/garment to purchase them get tedious. 
- We often come across fashion statements we don't know name of. 
- It's impossible to know names of all the different varieties of dresses.
- Watches, shoes, garments, accessories: with numerous varieties of each category, searching by word gets time consuming and often not effective.

## üì≤What it does?

- **Browse**: It allows the user to browse through its local files to seek for the image of the garment/accessory of their desire.
- **Enabled visual search**: It searches for similar garment/dress/accesory from its database.
- **Similar image recommendation**: it recommends similar choices for the user to choose from.

## How to get started

~~~bash
git clone https://github.com/SayantaniDeb01/Snapshop
~~~

## Installation

Use pip to install the requirements.

~~~bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
~~~

## Usage

To run the web server, simply execute streamlit with the main recommender app:

```bash
streamlit run main.py
```

## üß†Challenges faced 

- This was my very first time working on a machine learning project.
- It took a lot of time to train the model.
- Faced challenges during deployment of the app
- It was my first time working with streamlit as a frontend and python as the backend.
- It was tough to play around with streamlit considering its limited UI features.
-  Git Lfs was disabled due to exceeding the limit while simultaneously deploying with the huge kaggle dataset.
- Therefore it was not possible for the app to be deployed.


## ü•áAccomplishments I am proud of
- This was my first time working on a ML project ‚ú®I DID IT‚ú®
- Got to learn a lot and a overall nice experience!
- Made a new github account inorder to host the app in the streamlit server. [Link to the repo which is hosted in streamlit server](https://github.com/SayantaniDeb01/Snapshop)

## üöÄFuture Scope

The future scope is to integrate the ecommerce sites like myntra and amazon so that it can show the available items with direct link to purchase which are similar to the photo uploaded . This was beyond the scope of this project since it requires web scraping .
Current state of the project is a prototype , hoping to work on the future scope.
