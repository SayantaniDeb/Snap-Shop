Enhance shopping experience with Visual Search.<br>
You can find the app hosted [here](https://share.streamlit.io/sayantanideb/snap-shop/main.py)! 

## 💡Motivation 

- Searching for the name of accesories/garment to purchase them get tedious. 
- We often come across fashion statements we don't know name of. 
- It's impossible to know names of all the different varieties of dresses.
- Watches, shoes, garments, accessories: with numerous varieties of each category, searching by word gets time consuming and often not effective.

## 📲What it does?

- **Browse**: It allows the user to browse through its local files to seek for the image of the garment/accessory of their desire.
- **Enabled visual search**: It searches for similar garment/dress/accesory from its database.
- **Similar image recommendation**: it recommends similar choices for the user to choose from.

## Installation

Use pip to install the requirements.

~~~bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
~~~

## Usage

To run the web server, simply execute streamlit with the main recommender app:

```bash
streamlit run main.py
```

## 🧠Challenges faced 

- This was my very first time working on a machine learning project.
- It took a lot of time to train the model.
- Faced challenges during deployment of the app
- It was my first time working with streamlit as a frontend and python as the backend.
- It was tough to play around with streamlit considering its limited UI features.


## 🥇Accomplishments we are proud of
- This was my first time working on a ML project ✨I DID IT✨
- Got to learn a lot and a overall nice experience!

## 🚀Future Scope
- Can suggest garments/accesories after webscraping from the internet.
- Enable payment gateway to directly purchase from the site.
